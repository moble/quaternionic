"""Distance functions of quaternions

This module contains four distance functions:

  * `rotor.intrinsic`
  * `rotor.chordal`
  * `rotation.intrinsic`
  * `rotation.chordal`

The "rotor" distances do not account for possible differences in signs, meaning
that rotor distances can be large even when they represent identical rotations;
the "rotation" functions just return the smaller of the distance between `q1`
and `q2` or the distance between `q1` and `-q2`.  So, for example, either
"rotation" distance between `q` and `-q` is always zero, whereas neither
"rotor" distance between `q` and `-q` will ever be zero (unless `q` is zero).
The "intrinsic" functions measure the geodesic distance within the manifold of
*unit* quaternions, and is somewhat slower but may be more meaningful; the
"chordal" functions measure the Euclidean distance in the (linear) space of all
quaternions, and is faster but its precise value is not necessarily as
meaningful.

These functions satisfy some important conditions.  For each of these functions
`d`, and for any nonzero quaternions `q1` and `q2`, and *unit* quaternions `q3`
and `q4`, we have

  * symmetry: `d(q1, q2) = d(q2, q1)`
  * invariance: `d(q3*q1, q3*q2) = d(q1, q2) = d(q1*q4, q2*q4)`
  * identity: `d(q1, q1) = 0`
  * positive-definiteness:
    * For rotor functions `d(q1, q2) > 0` whenever `q1 ≠ q2`
    * For rotation functions `d(q1, q2) > 0` whenever `q1 ≠ q2` and `q1 ≠ -q2`

Note that the rotation functions also satisfy both the usual identity property
`d(q1, q1) = 0` and the opposite-identity property `d(q1, -q1) = 0`.

See [Moakher (2002)](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0895479801383877) for a nice
general discussion.
